Make a table comparing how many nodes are searched to find the answer for each problem. For this table, you should compare a number of different problems (at least 3) to avoid a statistical bias. 



1) Which heuristics did you use for the A* algorithm?
2) Which of the four algorithms searches the least nodes and which one take the most?
3) Why does this happen? 
4) Which algorithms are optimal? Why?
5) In your opinion what are the benefits of simpler algorithms versus more complex ones?
